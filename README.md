1- Import a teapot model
2- Apply Phong (Blinn-Phong) shading
3- Anti-alising enable/disable (Multisampled AA)
4- Using post-process(blur) with Multisample AA

In this project I used:
- "https://www.edx.org/course/computer-graphics-2" course materials. Teapot mesh, the function that imports the mesh, etc. There may be code lines that are in the course materials that occur also in my project.
- learnopengl.com" site for documentation. Some code lines on the site may be occur also in my project.

1- Import a teapot model
2- Apply Phong (Blinn-Phong) shading

In this project I used:
- "https://www.edx.org/course/computer-graphics-2" course materials. Teapot mesh, the function that imports the mesh, etc. There may be code lines that are in the course materials that occur also in my project.
- learnopengl.com" site for documentation. Some code lines on the site may be occur also in my project too.
